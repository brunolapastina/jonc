# JONC - Java on C++

A simple header-only library to call Java methods in C++ without having to think about all the JNI conversions

## Design Goals

The main goal of JONC is to make things simpler. It tries to achive that by using:
1. Compile time deduction of method signatures based on its call arguments
2. Automatic type conversion from C++ to Java and back

For primitive types, this signature deduction and type convertion is already implemented in the framework, but, of course, you can expand it to any user-defined type.

## Integration

To use this library, you need to include only the `jonc.hpp`.

```cpp
#include <jonc/jonc.hpp>
```

You will also need at leat C++11 support (in GCC and Clang, use -std=c++11). If you enable more recent C++ standards, the library will try to make the best use of it, so, if you can, do it!

## Examples

The [test folder](https://github.com/brunolapastina/jonc/tree/master/test) has a bunch of examples. Go there and take a look at the README.

## Acknowledgments

- [**Andrzej Krzemienski**](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com) for building this amazing [Compile-time string concatenation library](https://github.com/akrzemi1/static_string) fully explained in [this article](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/compile-time-string-concatenation/). Whith this library I was able to eliminate all the runtime overhead of dynamically building the method signatures.
