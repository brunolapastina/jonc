# Examples

Ok... I might have overstated when I said "a bunch" of examples. There are not many yet, but I will be expanding as I improve testing and add more features

## Compiling

To compile any example, just go to its respective directory and run

```shell
make
./test_[example_name]
```

for example, to run the *primitive_types* type:

```shell
make
./test_primitive_types
```

## Available tests

- [**Primitive types convertion:**](primitive_types) demonstrate all the Java-To-C++ and C++-To-Java primitive type convertions.
